timeTrack
A simple open source application designed to track time and create a time sheet for small businesses. We are working hard to make this project open source so that it can be used as a tool for startups. In the future licencing may only be free up to a certain number of employees, however for now it will remain entirely free!

Update: As progress continues Time Track might eventually be tranferred to Bit Bucket. There are many reasons for this, and even though we would like to keep it 100% open source due to the system we are planning to set up (using our server) this may not be possible.
